# How to contribute

If you are handy with R and inclined to help out, you can propose enhancements and bug fixes via pull request to the development branch.

If you decide to do so, please make my life easier by following these points:
- [ ] Keep it simple. I will not accept any large-scale changes without prior communication, discussion and aggreement.
- [ ] Document your code and generally follow good legible coding guidelines. If I can't figure out what you've done, I cannot authorise the merge.
- [ ] Avoid adding new dependencies, unless absolutely necessary.
- [ ] It must pass the existing tests and R CMD checks.
- [ ] Any new functionality must provide suitable additional tests.
- [ ] Submit your pull request to the development branch, not the master.
